I though it would be useful to collect data on my bash habits. I would like to use this data for zsh-like autocompletion.

Tools like zsh and autojump ( https://github.com/wting/autojump ) already exist, however this project allowed me to brush up on SQL and bash scripting.

# Installation
Clone this repo and source the shellAnalytics.sh script
```
git clone https://github.com/adam-gaia/shellAnalytics.git
source shellAnalytics/shellAnalytics.sh
```

# Usage
Run commands as you usually would. To display your stats, run ```
printShellAnalytics
```
